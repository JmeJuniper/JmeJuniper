### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jme! I will update this with more info later :D

#### How to get this on your profile
It's simple! Just make a repository that is the same name as your username (so for me it would be JmeJuniper), then add a README and have fun :D

<!--
**JmeJuniper/JmeJuniper** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
