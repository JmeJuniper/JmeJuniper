Am I a fisher,
or a fish in the water?
Maybe the former...
```

```
Why did I write this?
Nonsensical mess of words:
sin door perception
```

```
Yeah, they're pretty short and simple
But really fun and subtle
(Does that count?
My rhyming isn't paramount :/)
```

```
Help... running... of air...
In a probe... lost without... flare...
Please... need someone... care...

I can hear music
I have my headphones attached
The music is good

Oh hey, is that a limerik?
I like interesting rhyming schemes.
For example, this is an enclosed tercet!
```
---
```
Haikus are quite fun.
But alas, they are also plain.
I'll try limericks.
```
```
Limericks sound amazing.
They have to rhyme,
All the time,
It's really quite hazing!

But alas in my pursuit,
I made an enclosed rhyme,
And it was quite fine!
Actually, make that two.

"Two fruits turned to one,"
Said the rabbit, leaving to run.
"You can't take that, my friend,"
The farmer said,
But the rabbit already stole the plum.

Mountains are tall.
Why am I talking about them at all?
I have no clue.
What about you?
My mind has lots of random ideas, like a poem about fall.
```
```
Fall is fall.
Not autumn.
Why does "autumn" make me so glum?
I can't figure it out after all. 
```

```
Oh no here's another poem
Why do I make them so long
Wait a minute, I just added that to sound rhymed
All of my poems are pretty quickly-timed
```

First line of a rhyme

Alas, that was a one-liner
```
---
```
Here's another poem,
This one's rhymes will be the same word
Is it still a poem?
Perhaps I should find another rhyming word
```
---
```
woah long rhymes
I love reading these all the time
Oh no, rhyme and time is bad
It's so often used it's pretty much a fad
One rhyme after another
A total of two, that's a doubler
Four total line rhyme doubles
What goes here? Last line troubles.

the broughamms scraunched,
along the road. Yes, that line
was longer than #2
